# Disease Prediction from patient's symptoms.

## Overview

This project explores a decision tree model which can help predict whether a patient is diabetic or not. 
We built the decision tree classifier from scratch and used the sci-kit learn library to build the decision tree visualizer. It is a supervised machine learning model and is trained on the labelled dataset prepared by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Algorithms Explored

The following algorithms have been explored in code:

1. ID3 algorithm
2. Decision Tree

## Dataset

### Source

The dataset for this problem used with the main.py script is downloaded from here:
