# disease_predictor
A decision tree model which can help predict whether a patient is diabetic or not. 
We built the decision tree classifier from scratch and used the sci-kit learn library to build the decision tree visualizer. It is a supervised machine learning model and is trained on the labelled dataset prepared by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
